# Brain-Tumor-Classification-

1. INTRODUCTION

Brain tumor is the collection is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells. Brain tumors can be both malignant or benign. The most common types of brain tumors are Glioma, Meningioma and Pituitary tumor. 

There are several medical imaging techniques used to acquire information about tumors (tumor type, shape, size, location, etc.), which are needed for their diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most used technique. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.

The goal of this project is to develop a Deep Learning approach by using Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning (TL) to detect and classify Brain Tumor.
